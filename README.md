obake is a C++17 library for the symbolic manipulation of sparse polynomials
and other closely-related mathematical objects (e.g., truncated power
series, Poisson series, etc.). obake is the successor of the
[piranha](https://github.com/bluescarni/piranha) project.

If you are using obake as part of your research, teaching, or other activities, we would be grateful if you could star
the repository and/or cite our work. The DOI of the latest version and other citation resources are available

obake is under active development. Preliminary documentation
(including installation instructions) is available
[here](https://bluescarni.github.io/obake).
